Minor:
  code: MQE
  name: Quantitative Economics
  description: >
    The Minor in Quantitative Economics offers a course of study for undergraduates whose home 
    department is in the natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering and who are interested in 
    economics. The minor provides students with a plan of study and a selection of courses to apply 
    their mathematical training to economic anaalysis. The minor also provides a path to graduate 
    school for students who do not major in economics.
    
    Students will develop a good understanding of key economic concepts and will be able to apply 
    these concepts to new problems. The prerequisites and the two required courses provide a 
    methodological foundation, while the elective courses apply those methods in applications.
    
    Open for the Class of 2025 and later, this new minor begins students with the mathematical 
    versions of intermediate courses and then steers them to the more mathematical upper-level core 
    Economics courses.
