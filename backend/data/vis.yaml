  The Visual Arts minor under the Lewis Center for the Arts, promotes an environment where students are urged to explore visual art and media through hands-on creative engagement. The curriculum spans drawing, filmmaking, graphic design, media, painting, photography, and sculpture, mentored by contemporary practicing artists. The program opens its doors to all Princeton students with a few courses reserved for VIS minors and Practice of Art track students. The minor provides two pathways for those inclined towards a thesis in studio arts or film production.
