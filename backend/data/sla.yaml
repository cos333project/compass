Minor:
  code: SLA
  name: Slavic Languages and Cultures
  description: >
    The Slavic department at Princeton invites students to delve into the 
    literature and culture of Russia and the Slavic world, aiming to provide a 
    critically informed appreciation. Majors achieve a high level of proficiency
    enabling them to work with both primary and secondary sources in target 
    languages like BCS, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. The minor is 
    structured to augment the knowledge of students majoring in other 
    departments, increasing their competitiveness in various career paths 
    including law, medicine, business, government, nonprofits, consulting, 
    and humanities fields like theater, art, and curatorial work.
