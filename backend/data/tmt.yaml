  The Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication (PTIC) fosters a deep understanding of linguistic translation across various fields, including humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, arts, and engineering. Recognizing translation as a critical component in global communication, PTIC facilitates engagement with real-world translation needs, connecting academic insights with broader community services. The program extends beyond theoretical discussions, with a minor designed for undergraduates keen on mastering language use and navigating the complexities of intercultural communication. PTIC does not offer translator training but provides a rich platform for exploring translation in its manifold dimensions.
