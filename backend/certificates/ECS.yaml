- name: ECS Senior Thesis Colloquium 
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: In their senior year, ECS students participate in the Senior Thesis Colloquium. Although ECS certificate students complete their 
    theses under the direction of their home departments, over the course of the spring term of senior year, all ECS seniors join the 
    ECS director to meet one day a week, over a meal, for discussion of common challenges of research, conceptualization, organization and 
    writing. Each student shares an excerpt from the senior thesis with the group during one of the colloquium's meetings. Senior thesis excerpts 
    are circulated in advance, and active participation in the weekly senior thesis colloquium discussions is required of all ECS seniors. 
    Though most ECS students address European topics in their theses, this is not a requirement of the program. For the purposes of the senior thesis 
    colloquium, certificate students from the sciences or engineering may circulate a paper written for an ECS course in place of an excerpt from the senior thesis.
