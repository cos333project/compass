type: Minor
name: Quantitative Economics
code: MQE
description: The Minor in Quantitative Economics is designed for 
  undergraduates from the natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering 
  departments who have an interest in economics. This minor equips 
  students to apply their mathematical knowledge to economic analysis, 
  serving as a gateway to graduate school for non-economics majors. It 
  introduces students to key economic concepts through a mathematically 
  rigorous curriculum, beginning with intermediate-level courses, 
  followed by upper-level core Economics courses, tailored to the 
  mathematical aptitude of the students.
