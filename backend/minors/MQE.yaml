description: The Minor in Quantitative Economics is designed for undergraduates from the natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering departments who have an interest in economics. This minor equips students to apply their mathematical knowledge to economic analysis, serving as a gateway to graduate school for non-economics majors. It introduces students to key economic concepts through a mathematically rigorous curriculum, beginning with intermediate-level courses, followed by upper-level core Economics courses, tailored to the mathematical aptitude of the students.
