description: 
  The interdisciplinary minor in values and public life, offered by the University Center for Human Values, focuses on modes of inquiry into important ethical issues in public life. The program helps students develop competence in pursuing such inquiries generally and supports them in applying these 
  intellectual skills to the advanced analysis of one or more related topics. Students who complete the minor will be equipped to bring informed discussion of values into the public sphere and to integrate a critical value perspective into their future studies and pursuits. The minor is open to rising juniors intending to major in any discipline.

  explanation: Students will write a senior thesis, a portion of a senior thesis (or, in exceptional circumstances, another substantial piece of independent work) on a normative topic approved 
  by both the director of the program and the normal procedures of the student's department of concentration. The thesis will be written according to the department regulations of the student's 
  major. Students will be expected to participate in non-credit-bearing senior thesis workshops convened by the minor that discuss the different aspects of ethical study presented in the participantsâ€™ 
  projects and that support the writing of the thesis.
