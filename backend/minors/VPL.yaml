It steers students towards proficiently examining ethical issues and applying these analytical skills to explore one or more correlated topics. The minor aims to capacitate students with the ability to invoke informed discussions on values in the public domain, and assimilate a critical value viewpoint in their future scholarly and professional endeavors. The program is open to rising juniors from all disciplines.
