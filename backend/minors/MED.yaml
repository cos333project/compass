description: 
Minor:
The Program in Medieval Studies encourages the interdisciplinary study 
  of the Middle Ages; its art, literature (Latin and vernacular), music, 
  religion, science, philosophy, politics, and economic and social structures. 
  Supported by the vast resources for medieval studies at Princeton 
  (including an outstanding medieval manuscript collection and the 
  photographic archive known as the Index of Medieval Art), the program 
  sponsors one course; an introductory seminar, and a (noncredit) thesis 
  writers' colloquium for seniors. Other courses directly relevant to 
  medieval studies are listed under the courses section.

  explanation: MED HUM HIS HLS 227 (Worlds of the Middle Ages), offered in 
    alternate falls, is the designated introductory course for the minor. 
    Students may consult the director for comparably broad introductory 
    course offerings that may be taken instead (e.g., HUM216–217, HIS210, 
    ART228). Students are encouraged to complete their introductory class 
    as early as possible in their course of study.

    explanation: One larger final project on a relevant topic completed in the senior year, amounting to the equivalent of one thesis chapter or more. 
      Project forms include a departmental senior thesis, a substantive data-based project on primary sources and materials, internships that require 
      intensive work with primary sources. Please discuss the range of possibilities (and Princeton’s own opportunities) with the director. In the 
      senior thesis colloquium, taught by the director of the program, these projects, activities, experiences and expertise will be regularly 
      presented and discussed during senior year.

  explanation: Students are encouraged to study an appropriate source language in the department of their choice. Two semesters of a relevant medieval 
    source language at the 100 level, or one medieval source language course at the 200 level or above, will count as one course toward the minor. 
    Relevant languages include Latin, Classical Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Classical Chinese, Classical Japanese and Persian; for other relevant languages, 
    including possible graduate courses, students should consult with the program director.
