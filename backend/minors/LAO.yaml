description: The Program in Latino Studies, administered by the Effron 
  Center for the Study of America, offers an interdisciplinary 
  curriculum that traverses the arts, humanities and social sciences. 
  The program is designed to provide students with a broad understanding 
  of the emergence, transformation and consolidation of Latino/a/x as a 
  pan-ethnic group 
  central to the development of the United States as a nation. The 
  course of study also highlights the transnational connections and 
  contexts of Latino/a/x peoples across the Americas, including dynamics 
  of globalization, migration, colonialism, imperialism, citizenship and 
  diaspora.
