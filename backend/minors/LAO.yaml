description: The Program in Latino Studies, administered by the Effron 
Center for the Study of America, offers an interdisciplinary curriculum 
that traverses the arts, humanities and social sciences. The program is 
designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the emergence, 
transformation and consolidation of Latino/a/x as a pan-ethnic group 
central to the development of the United States as a nation. The course 
of study also highlights the transnational connections and contexts of 
Latino/a/x peoples across the Americas, including dynamics of globalization, 
migration, colonialism, imperialism, citizenship and diaspora.
