description: The Program in Latino Studies, administered by the Effron 
Center for the Study of America, offers an interdisciplinary curriculum 
that traverses the arts, humanities and social sciences. The program is 
designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the emergence, 
transformation and consolidation of Latino/a/x as a pan-ethnic group 
central to the development of the United States as a nation. The course 
of study also highlights the transnational connections and contexts of 
Latino/a/x peoples across the Americas, including dynamics of globalization, 
migration, colonialism, imperialism, citizenship and diaspora.

  explanation: Three courses in Latino studies, either originating in the program or 
  cross-listed, and preferably representing disciplinary breadth in the social 
  sciences, arts and humanities. No more than one course taken in fulfillment of 
  the student’s concentration may be counted toward the certificate. With the 
  approval of the associate director, a student may substitute a comparative race 
  and ethnicity course that contains substantial Latino studies content for one 
  of these courses.
