description: 
  Students at Princeton develop the skills of a linguist through 
  hands-on engagement with gathering and interpreting data from many different 
  languages, the employment of diverse methodologies, and the investigation of 
  language through a variety of lenses, including;
  Working with native speakers of an unfamiliar language (Field Methods).
  Engaging with descriptive grammars and large-scale statistical correlations to investigate 
  similarities and differences across languages (Linguistic Typology).
  Analyzing texts to elucidate how language changes over time (Historical Linguistics).
  Modeling linguistic differences across dialects and social contexts (Sociolinguistics).
  Measuring linguistic behaviors in controlled experimental contexts (Psycholinguistics).
  Observing how languages develop/coexist within speakers (Language Acquisition, Bilingualism).

  explanation: Some substantial aspect of linguistics should be incorporated either into the 
    student’s junior independent work or into their senior thesis. This requirement is typically 
    met either by writing a junior paper or senior thesis on a linguistics topic or topic related 
    to linguistics (i.e., a topic that satisfies the requirements of both the student’s major 
    and minor), or by including a chapter on a linguistics topic in a senior thesis whose general 
    topic is not directly related to linguistics. If this is not feasible, students should contact 
    the director of undergraduate program for alternative arrangements, which in most cases will 
    involve writing a short piece of independent work on a topic related to linguistics, 
    supervised by a member of the LIN faculty.
