  description: >
    Students at Princeton develop the skills of a linguist through 
    hands-on engagement with gathering and interpreting data from many different 
    languages, the employment of diverse methodologies, and the investigation of 
    language through a variety of lenses, including;

    Working with native speakers of an unfamiliar language (Field Methods).
    Engaging with descriptive grammars and large-scale statistical correlations to investigate 
    similarities and differences across languages (Linguistic Typology).
    Analyzing texts to elucidate how language changes over time (Historical Linguistics).
    Modeling linguistic differences across dialects and social contexts (Sociolinguistics).
    Measuring linguistic behaviors in controlled experimental contexts (Psycholinguistics).
    Observing how languages develop/coexist within speakers (Language Acquisition, Bilingualism).

    Beyond the linguistic knowledge mastered through such coursework, students of 
    linguistics will gain a number of valuable skills that extend to nearly every domain, 
    including; logical problem-solving, gathering and organizing large data sets, 
    recognizing patterns, making and testing hypotheses, and 
    identifying problems in and prospects for analytical approaches.
