degree:
description: The minor in Music Performance is a rigorous opportunity for students to study
   the performance of vocal and instrumental music (both jazz and classical) or conducting in the 
  context of a liberal arts education. It provides extensive opportunities for students to hone their 
  skills through participation in department ensembles, recitals, studio instruction and performance classes, 
  and also requires coursework in the Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making (M&M) distribution 
  areas. The MPP minor provides a solid foundation for students who may wish to pursue professional music 
  training at the graduate level.

    explanation: One additional MPP or MUS elective, chosen in consultation with relevant program director
      By petition to the relevant program director, one of these electives can be outside MUS, though must reflect a 
      coherent plan of study (i.e., a particular African American studies course in support of a plan of study focusing on Jazz Performance).

  explanation: Ensemble participation in an approved faculty-led Music Department Ensemble is required in all four semesters of the junior and senior
   years. The specific ensemble must be for the instrument and performance tradition for which the student was admitted. For cases in which the department does 
   not offer a faculty-led ensemble for the instrument (e.g., classical piano, classical guitar, conducting), students may audition for a different faculty-led 
   ensemble to fulfill the MPP minor ensemble participation requirement, or may pursue equivalent collaborative assignments as detailed on the Music Department website.

  explanation: Studio lessons are required and must be taken with a Department of Music studio instructor or, if applicable, a program director. More specific parameters 
    will differ depending on the instrument/performance practice for which the student is admitted. Students will have the option to enroll in lessons for credit (MPP298/299) 
    if they want their work in lessons to be specifically reflected on their transcript. Students who choose to do so may NOT count this course toward completion of MPP course requirements.
- name: Recital or Related Program-Specific Performance 
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: A recital or related program-specific performance is required in senior year, which would be a demonstration of core study with the program approved by both 
    applicable studio instructor and relevant program director.
