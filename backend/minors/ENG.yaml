description: In the Department of English students are trained 
to read critically and to attend to the imbricated histories of 
language, literature, culture, and power. Students read widely 
across genres and periods of British, American, and Anglophone 
literature as well as across a variety of critical and theoretical 
approaches. In addition to lectures and seminars devoted to poetry, 
prose, and drama, English offers courses on cinema, photography, 
architecture, the public essay, and data and culture, among other 
media and topics. We encourage students to think across disciplines 
and languages, and we offer vital skills and resources that support 
independent research.

    explanation: English minors must take five courses, at least 
      two of them seminars. Just as there are no prerequisites, 
      there are also no required courses for the minor. As detailed 
      above, the department will offer suggestions as to possible 
      clusters but we will also invite students to chart their own 
      paths and propose a new cluster.
