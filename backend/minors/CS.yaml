description: Climate science is math, physics, chemistry, biology and 
  computer sciences, applied together to understand how Earth's climate 
  works, how it has changed in the past and how it will change in the 
  future. Whether students are interested in policymaking, 
  sustainability, natural hazards, city planning, pollution, 
  geoengineering, natural resources, energy or conservation, a broad and 
  accurate understanding of climate science is required.
