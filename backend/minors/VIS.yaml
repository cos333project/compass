  The Visual Arts minor under the Lewis Center for the Arts, promotes an environment where students are urged to explore visual art and media through hands-on creative engagement. The curriculum spans drawing, filmmaking, graphic design, media, painting, photography, and sculpture, mentored by contemporary practicing artists. The program opens its doors to all Princeton students with a few courses reserved for VIS minors and Practice of Art track students. The minor provides two pathways for those inclined towards a thesis in studio arts or film production.

  explanation: VIS 392 Artist and Studio is a fall seminar required for all junior year Practice of Art students and students engaged in the visual arts minor. Concentrating on the traditions, challenges and rewards of studio practice through readings, discussions, 
  studio critiques and a culminating exhibition of artist's books, VIS 392 provides students with historical context as well as contemporary theory of how best to engage in a meaningful studio practice. In conjunction with the seminar, each junior receives their 
  own art studio. Please note that film students are required to take VIS 419 (The Film Seminar) in the spring of their junior year as one of the two required film seminars. They may take VIS 392 as their second required seminar or find another film-related
  seminar on campus that qualifies, with prior approval from film faculty.

  explanation: 
   Students will be assigned one adviser in the fall and a different adviser for the spring, both chosen from the Program in Visual Arts faculty. Each student is assigned a studio workspace for the year in the loft of 185 Nassau. In lieu of writing a 
   fall paper, students will conceive and produce a 32-page artist's book for their fall independent work. The independent work is done in consultation with each student's adviser.
   Over the spring semester, students prepare independent work in their studios, in consultation with their spring semester adviser, culminating in an exhibition as part of the junior thesis group show.

Please note that film students work with one adviser throughout their junior year to create a junior film.- name: Senior Independent Work
