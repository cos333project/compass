    explanation: VIS 392 Artist and Studio is a fall seminar required for all junior year Practice of Art students and students engaged in the visual arts minor. Concentrating on the traditions, challenges and rewards of studio practice through readings, discussions, 
      studio critiques and a culminating exhibition of artist's books, VIS 392 provides students with historical context as well as contemporary theory of how best to engage in a meaningful studio practice. In conjunction with the seminar, each junior receives their 
      own art studio. Please note that film students are required to take VIS 419 (The Film Seminar) in the spring of their junior year as one of the two required film seminars. They may take VIS 392 as their second required seminar or find another film-related
      seminar on campus that qualifies, with prior approval from film faculty.

The independent work is done in consultation with each student's adviser.
    
    Over the spring semester, students prepare independent work in their studios, in consultation with their spring semester adviser, culminating in an exhibition as part of the junior thesis group show.
