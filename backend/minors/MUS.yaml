type: Minor
name: Music
code: MUS
degree:
description: The minor in the Department of Music invites students to explore a diverse range of fields of study, from composition and electronic music, to musicology, theory, sound 
  studies, music cognition, jazz studies and more. Students pursue work in two loosely defined areas; Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making (M&M). M&M encompasses 
  topics usually explored in hands-on, exploratory ways, such as composition, improvisation, theory, analysis and electronic music. The C&C area focuses on the scholarly study of 
  music, from historical and formalist analysis to cognitive science and ethnography. While independent work is not required, there are options for students interested in 
  pursuing private lessons (in composition and electronic music), studies in music cognition (through the Music Cognition Lab), research projects with faculty, or the Music 
  Mentorship program that pairs music undergraduates with graduate students.

    explanation: 2 Additional MUS courses. By petition to the DUS, one of these electives can be outside 
    MUS, though must reflect a coherent plan of study (for instance, a particular psychology 
      course in support of a plan of study focusing on music cognition)
