Minor:
  code: MUS
  name: MUSIC
  description: >
    Through an open-ended set of course requirements, the minor will introduce students to the wide range of possible fields of study within music and give them the flexibility to forge paths inspired by their own imaginations.

    It is our goal that the resulting teaching and research afforded by this open-ended minor will continue to expand our core identity beyond the borders of western cultural traditions and provide a vibrant pathway to/through EDI work. Further, we anticipate that this minor will foster more of the interdisciplinary opportunities that are so fundamental and unique to the Princeton experience; by inviting students to bring what they are studying in their majors to bear on our music practices and, in turn, offering new lenses through which they can metabolize their studies in other areas, the potential of music to suggest new modes of thinking, making and learning can be more fully realized.

    While independent work is not required, there are ample opportunities for students in the music minor to further their classroom work via private lessons in composition and electronic music, studies in music cognition (through the Music Cognition Lab) or research projects with faculty.
