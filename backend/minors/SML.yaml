  explanation: Students are required to complete at least one semester of independent work in their junior or senior year on a topic that 
  applies SML methods or investigates these methods. This work may be used to satisfy the IW requirement of the SML minor and the student's 
  major. All work will be reviewed by the Statistics and Machine Learning Minor committee. In May, there will be an (online) poster session in 
  which students must present their independent work to other students, researchers, and the faculty. Students must adhere to submission due 
  dates for independent work papers and poster requirements.
