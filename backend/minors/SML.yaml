description: 
  This minor, under the guidance of the Center for Statistics and 
  Machine Learning (CSML), enables students to grasp the core principles 
  of statistics, coding, and machine learning. It prepares them to apply 
  these skills across various domains. Students are encouraged to enroll 
  by spring of sophomore year, but no later than the start of senior

  explanation: Students are required to complete at least one semester of independent work in their junior or senior year on a topic that 
    applies SML methods or investigates these methods. This work may be used to satisfy the IW requirement of the SML minor and the student's 
    major. All work will be reviewed by the Statistics and Machine Learning Minor committee. In May, there will be an (online) poster session in 
    which students must present their independent work to other students, researchers, and the faculty. Students must adhere to submission due 
    dates for independent work papers and poster requirements.
