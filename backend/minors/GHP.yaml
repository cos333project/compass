  explanation: GHP students will complete an internship or research experience during the summer 
    between junior and senior year. This provides students an opportunity to apply concepts from 
    the core GHP courses and any electives taken to date in a real-world context. This experience 
    must be full-time and must be a minimum of eight weeks in duration. The internship may be remote. 
    All internships must be approved in advance by the minor.

  explanation: Students must take four additional elective courses in global health. Students may 
    choose from an elective list that is curated and approved in advance every semester by the minor.
    Three of the four electives must be taken in junior or senior year.
    One elective may be taken in the first year or sophomore year.
    Students may petition to the minor for a course to be approved as a GHP elective prior to the start of the semester. Elective petitions will not be accepted after the start of the semester or after the course has been completed.
    Elective courses may be at the 200-, 300-, or 400 level. Students may petition to the minor for a 500-level course to be approved as a GHP elective on an individual basis. 100-level courses will not be approved as electives.
    A student may count a maximum of two 200-level courses toward the four elective total. If a cross- listed course carries both a 200- and 300-level course number, it will count as a 200-level course for purposes of this requirement.
    At least one elective course must not be listed or cross-listed with the studentâ€™s major.
    One course taken off-campus, including study abroad courses, may be taken as an elective with prior minor approval.
