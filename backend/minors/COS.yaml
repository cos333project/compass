description: The Computer Science Minor is designed for students who 
  want to combine the study of computing and computers with another 
  academic discipline. The program welcomes students not only from areas 
  that traditionally make heavy use of computation (such as engineering, 
  the natural sciences and mathematics) but also from newer and emerging 
  application areas (such as neuroscience, digital humanities, 
  technology policy, music, visual arts, economics, linguistics and 
  philosophy).

  explanation: Three additional Princeton COS course at the 200-, 300-, 
    or 400-level, except IW courses (COS 397, 398, 497 and 498). 
    This includes courses cross-listed in COS, regardless of the home 
    department. It excludes graduate courses and courses taken at other 
    institutions. If a student takes both COS 217 and COS 226, then one 
    of them may count as an elective.
