type: Minor
name: Neuroscience
code: NEU
degree:
description: The minor in neuroscience at Princeton is designed for Princeton University undergraduate students 
  with a strong interest in the brain but whose primary studies are in a different subject area. The certificate 
  in neuroscience has been serving this function since 2006, but since neuroscience now has a major, transitioning 
  the certificate to a minor is appropriate. The PNI faculty believe that the current requirements of the NEU 
  certificate are sufficient for a minor and have endorsed changing the name without modifications to the requirements. 
  The requirements for the NEU minor are all related to coursework. There is no independent work requirement for the 
  neuroscience certificate.
