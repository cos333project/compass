  explanation: Students must also complete a substantial piece of 
    research (20â€“25 pages) based at least in part on Chinese language 
    sources dealing with aspects of East Asia. The topic must be in the 
    humanities or social sciences. The paper could be either an original 
    piece of research or a junior paper or senior thesis. If the paper 
    or senior thesis is written for another department, at least half of 
    the work must be on East Asia.

# Notes: An East Asian studies major specializing in Japanese or Korean
# language may earn a language minor in Chinese, but may not also earn
# an East Asian studies minor offered by the Program in East Asian
# Studies.
# I am confused about the min needed/max counted thing.
