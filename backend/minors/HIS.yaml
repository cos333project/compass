description: Understanding the human past is essential to living in the
  present and shaping the future. The themes explored in History courses
  address questions about the transformation of societies over time and 
  the diversity of human experience, through the study of politics and 
  conflict, religion, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, or the 
  production of knowledge (among many themes). By juxtaposing 
  current-day assumptions and biases against the norms and prejudices 
  from the distant past and other cultures, the study of history 
  provides valuable insights on how we are situated in the present. For 
  students majoring in the natural sciences or engineering, the History 
  minor provides the opportunity to pursue a parallel intellectual 
  journey. For students majoring in other humanities or social science 
  disciplines, the History minor complements their course of study.

    explanation: |- 
      Students are required to write a research paper (minimum length of 12 pages) with substantive primary source engagement. The research paper will normally be written for a HIS course and revised as needed to meet the requirements of the minor. 
      
      In addition, students will submit a 500-word methodological reflection on the research and writing process. 
      
      The undergraduate program director for history will review the submitted work and verify that it satisfies departmental requirements.
