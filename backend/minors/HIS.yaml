description: Understanding the human past is essential to living in the
  present and shaping the future. The themes explored in History courses
  address questions about the transformation of societies over time and the
  diversity of human experience, through the study of politics and conflict,
  religion, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, or the production of
  knowledge (among many themes). By juxtaposing current-day assumptions and
  biases against the norms and prejudices from the distant past and other
  cultures, the study of history provides valuable insights on how we are
  situated in the present. For students majoring in the natural sciences or
  engineering, the History minor provides the opportunity to pursue a parallel
  intellectual journey. For students majoring in other humanities or social
  science disciplines, the History minor complements their course of study.

    explanation: Students are required to write a research paper (minimum length
      of 12 pages) with substantive primary source engagement. The research paper
      will normally be written for a HIS course and revised as needed to meet the
      requirements of the minor. In addition, students will submit a 500-word
      methodological reflection on the research and writing process. The
      undergraduate program director for history will review the submitted
      work and verify that it satisfies departmental requirements.

# note: The History minor is open to all undergraduate students, without prerequisite.

The exceptions are History majors and students pursuing the History of Science, Technology, 
and Medicine minor (HSTM), who are not eligible for the HIS minor.
