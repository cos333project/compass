description: The Program in Dance, part of the Lewis Center for the 
  Arts, welcomes all students to engage and experiment with dance. At 
  the core of the program is the belief that dance fosters an 
  integration of mind and body that allows for a greater connection to 
  ourselves and our communities. To that end, the dance minor offers 
  students deep exposure to and appreciation of dance through practice, 
  performance and critical conversation.

    All students planning to earn the minor in dance must complete the show support requirement (formerly referred to as “tech hours”) by supporting one dance program show in a nonperforming capacity. 
    
    Students who will propose an independent choreographic or performance project during their senior year must have completed the show support requirement by the end of their junior year.
