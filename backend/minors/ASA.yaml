description: The Program in Asian American Studies, administered by the 
  Effron Center for the Study of America, provides students with the 
  opportunity to gain an interdisciplinary perspective on the diversity 
  of Asian American and Pacific Islander histories, cultures and 
  contemporary experiences. The course of study focuses on the formative 
  emergence of this pan-ethnic group in the United States. It also 
  highlights Asian America’s transnational connections and contexts, 
  including the dynamics of globalization, migration, imperialism and 
  postcoloniality.
