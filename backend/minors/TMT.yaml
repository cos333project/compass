description: The Program in Theater and Music Theater welcomes all students interested in exploring theater and music theater, with or without previous experience. We approach theater and music theater from a liberal arts perspective— as intensely collaborative 
  art forms, as key components of world cultures and as performance genres that shape and are shaped by history, economics, politics and technology. We research, study and perform theater, from classic plays, operas and musicals to contemporary, experimental and 
  devised plays, performances and musicals. We offer a wide-ranging, innovative and student-initiated season of theatrical explorations, produced in collaboration with professional artists and craftspeople. Our season centers on community-building and the creation 
  of original work, in which all students can participate, We encourage artistic and academic investigations of theater and music theater in conversation with every other area of study.
