description: The Department of East Asian Studies offers a wide range
  of undergraduate classes at the highest standards of academic,
  linguistic and cultural competence focused on China, Japan and Korea.
  It provides an opportunity for students who plan to major in other
  disciplines to simultaneously pursue a high level of proficiency in
  one or more East Asian language (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) and
  acquire the basic knowledge about the literature, history and culture
  of East Asia. The student’s independent work may be supervised by
  faculty members of the department, whose work covers East Asian
  literature, history, film and media, and anthropology. Students are
  also encouraged to work with other university faculty members 
  conducting research in and teaching on East Asia.

  explanation: |-
    Students must also complete a substantial piece of research (20-25 pages) based at least in part on Japanese language sources dealing with aspects of East Asia. The topic must be in the humanities or social sciences. 
    
    The paper could be either an original piece of research, or a junior paper or senior thesis. 
    
    If the paper or senior thesis is written for another department, at least half of the work must be on East Asia. 
    
    Students should submit a signed written work form at the time of the paper’s completion or one week before Dean’s Date in the spring of senior year. 
    
    The student is expected be proactive in seeking out a faculty reviewer for the written work requirement. If submitting a junior paper or senior thesis, the paper’s adviser may serve as the faculty reviewer. The faculty reviewer does not need to be an EAS department faculty, but their field must have relevancy to the topic and region of the student’s written work.
