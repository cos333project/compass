description: The program emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the study of materials and the engineering application of their properties. The program 
  is designed primarily for students in science and engineering departments who are considering careers in materials, or have general interest 
  in materials science and engineering, although students from other disciplines, with appropriate background, may join. Participants in 
  the program will take courses in their own department together with a group of materials courses chosen from a selected list offered by 
  the participating departments and/or the Princeton Materials Institute. Satisfactory completion of the program is recognized by the 
  award of a minor in materials science and engineering upon graduation.
