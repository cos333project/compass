description: The Department of East Asian Studies offers a wide range 
of undergraduate classes at the highest standards of academic, 
linguistic and cultural competence focused on China, Japan and Korea. 
It provides an opportunity for students who plan to major in other 
disciplines to simultaneously pursue a high level of proficiency in 
one or more East Asian language (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) and 
acquire the basic knowledge about the literature, history and culture 
of East Asia. The student’s independent work may be supervised by 
faculty members of the department, whose work covers East Asian 
literature, history, film and media, and anthropology. Students are 
also encouraged to work with other university faculty members conducting 
research in and teaching on East Asia.

  explanation: The program is open to undergraduates in all departments. 
  Students interested in earning a minor are encouraged to apply no earlier 
  than the spring of sophomore year and no later than the spring of 
  junior year. Final application materials, including the written work 
  form, should be filed with the Department of East Asian Studies office 
  by the deadline of one week before Dean's Date in the spring of the

  explanation: Students must also complete a substantial piece of research 
  (20-25 pages) based at least in part on Korean language sources 
  dealing with aspects of East Asia. The topic must be in the humanities 
  or social sciences. The paper could be either an original piece of 
  research, or a junior paper or senior thesis. If the paper or senior 
  thesis is written for another department, at least half of the work 
  must be on East Asia. Students should submit a signed written work form 
  at the time of the paper’s completion or one week before Dean’s Date 
  in the spring of senior year. The student is expected be proactive in 
  seeking out a faculty reviewer for the written work requirement. If 
  submitting a junior paper or senior thesis, the paper’s adviser may 
  serve as the faculty reviewer. The faculty reviewer does not need to 
  be an EAS department faculty, but their field must have relevancy to 
  the topic and region of the student’s written work. 
- name: Independent Work
  double_counting_allowed: true
  explanation: The written work requirement can be a paper written 
  exclusively/independently for the language minor, another piece of work 
  (i.e., a senior thesis, junior paper or substantial seminar paper), or a 
  hybrid (i.e., a previous paper that is independently expanded to meet all criteria)
