description: From climate change to pandemics to the transformative effects
  of information technology, many of the challenges we confront today are
  inseparable from science, technology and medicine, whether as cause,
  explanation or remedy. To understand the role of STM in our present
  predicament and think through how it will shape our future, a historical
  perspective is vital. In the HSTM minor, students will learn from the
  array of methodological approaches developed by historians of science,
  technology and medicine, and track the evolution of modern science from
  antiquity to the present, in many of the world’s cultures. For students
  majoring in the humanities and social sciences, the HSTM minor enhances
  their understanding of the content, methodologies and impacts of science,
  technology and medicine; in a complementary fashion, the HSTM minor provides
  students majoring in the natural sciences or engineering a richer
  appreciation of the social and cultural aspects of their fields, as well
  as the trajectories that brought their subjects to their present state.
