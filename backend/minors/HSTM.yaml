description: From climate change to pandemics to the transformative 
  effects of information technology, many of the challenges we confront 
  today are inseparable from science, technology and medicine, whether 
  as cause, explanation or remedy. To understand the role of HSTM in our 
  present predicament and think through how it will shape our future, a 
  historical perspective is vital. In the HSTM minor, students will 
  learn from the array of methodological approaches developed by 
  historians of science, technology and medicine, and track the 
  evolution of modern science from antiquity to the present, in many of 
  the world’s cultures. For students majoring in the humanities and 
  social sciences, the HSTM minor enhances their understanding of the 
  content, methodologies and impacts of science, technology and 
  medicine; in a complementary fashion, the HSTM minor provides students 
  majoring in the natural sciences or engineering a richer appreciation 
  of the social and cultural aspects of their fields, as well as the 
  trajectories that brought their subjects to their present state.
