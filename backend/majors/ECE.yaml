description: |-
  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers an 
  academic program of study spanning a wide range of disciplines, 
  connecting the broad fields of information, data, communication and 
  computing systems to circuits, energy and the physical world. To 
  prepare students for a future beyond Princeton, the three main themes 
  of the program are (i) a broad foundation, (ii) depth and expertise in 
  a major, and (iii) independent work and design.

    Electrical and Computer Engineering 201, 203, and at least one of 
    206 or 308. This requirement is normally satisfied by the end of 
    sophomore year, although 206 and 308 can be delayed if 
    foundational courses in related disciplines make this difficult. 
    These courses are all open to all qualified first-year students.

    An engineering course with a significant scientific component must 
    be taken outside of ECE to satisfy this requirement. Many courses 
    can be used to satisfy this requirement; note, however, that a 
    course comprised largely of mathematics or applied mathematics does 
    not satisfy the requirement. The course used to satisfy the 
    engineering science requirement cannot also be used to satisfy the 
    major requirement or the breadth requirement, nor can it be counted 
    as a departmental requirement. The following is a non-exhaustive 
    list of possibilities: COS 217, 226, 320, 402, 423, 425, 451, 487;

    ECE students must take at least two upper-level (300- or 400-level) 
    technical courses in each of the last four terms, called 
    "departmental" courses. Of the eight departmental courses, at least 
    five must be ECE courses and normally include 302 and the senior 
    thesis (497, 498). The remaining three courses can be taken in CEE, 
    CHM, CBE, COS, EEB, ECE, ENE, MAE, MAT, MOL, MSE, NEU, ORF, or PHY. 
    Courses in or cross-listed with electrical and computer engineering 
    counted toward this requirement must be closely related to the 
    student's academic program.
