description: |-
  Operations research and financial engineering may be considered as the
  modern form of a liberal education: modern because it is based on 
  science, mathematics, computing and technology, and liberal in the 
  sense that it provides for broad intellectual development and can 
  lead to many different types of careers. By choosing judiciously from
  courses in engineering, science, mathematics, economics, public 
  policy, and liberal arts, each student may design a program adapted
  to his or her particular interests.

  All students start from a common academic core consisting of
  statistics, probability and stochastic processes, and optimization.
  Related courses focus on developing computer skills and exposing
  students to applications in areas such as finance, operations, 
  transportation, and logistics. Students augment the core program with
  a coherent sequence of departmental electives. Students may also
  design specialized programs in areas such as medicine and 
  neuroscience, which must be reviewed and approved by their academic
  adviser and the departmental representative. Students often draw on
  courses from economics, computer science, applied mathematics, civil
  and environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry,
  molecular biology, psychology, and public and international affairs.
  Requirements for study in the department follow the general
  requirements for the School of Engineering and Applied Science
  and the University.

  explanation: |-
    The departmental electives represent courses that further develop a 
    student’s skills in mathematical modeling either by a more in-depth
    investigation of core methodologies, applying these skills in specific
    areas of application, or learning about closely related technologies.
    Students must choose ten courses from the following list, with the
    following constraints:

    1. There must be at least four courses from ORFE.
    2. There can be no more than three courses from any one department
    (excluding ORFE).

    A full-year thesis (or a one semester project plus an additional 400-level ORFE departmental) involving an application of the techniques in the program applied to a topic that the student chooses in consultation with a faculty adviser.

    Senior Thesis - ORF 478 - A full year effort that involves a major application of the techniques in the program applied to a topic that a student chooses in consultation with a faculty advisor. Students interested in a full-year senior thesis must be willing to spend the appropriate time during both the fall and the spring semesters.

    Students who are unable to make adequate progress can switch to ORF 479 and be required to take eleven departmental electives. Students will enroll in the spring and will receive credit for two course grades given in the spring.

    OR

    Senior Independent Project - ORF 479 (Spring semester only) - A short progress report will be due in January, (Dean’s Date) to make sure that the students have chosen a suitable topic and matched up with their advisor. The final outcome will be a report due at the end of the spring semester. The report will fully describe the research project and its results. Typically projects will take approximately 30 to 50 pages. (Also, students who take the independent project will need to take an additional 4XX ORFE departmental elective.)
