Reading primary sources from the history of science, each class will trace the reverberations of scientific racism in media, education, politics, law, and global health. Our conversations will consistently analyze the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, age, and disability in the legacies of scientific racism. We will also examine the impact of scientific racism in public discourse about the Black Lives Matter Movement and collectively brainstorm for activism towards restorative justice."        ,               0 ,                  0 ,FUL           ,                 0 ,                      0 ,            0 ,Topics in Global Race and Ethnicity                                                ,                      0 ,                0 ,HA                      ,                  30 ,                  0 ,The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach about Hum ,Genealogy of Racism                                            ,"Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-" ,                                                             ,                                                              ,                                                              ,                     ,                     ,                     ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,                      ,

In nearly a century of research the only consistency in their characterization is as internal Other from the vantage of the law. This class will investigate how the category of ""the gang"" serves to provoke imaginaries of racial unrest and discourses of ""dangerous,"" threatening subjects in urban enclaves.
